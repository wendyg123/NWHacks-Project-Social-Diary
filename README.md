**Our story:** 

We're currently living in a time where students have never felt more isolated, stressed, and alone.

The Social Diary is designed to connect students, counselors, professors and other university resources so every student can get the help and support they need when they need it! 

This incredibly easy, engaging Q&A platform saves time and helps students overcome mental health barriers and various learning difficulties using the power of community. 

Anonymous posting also encourages every student to participate along with university officials.

We sincerely hope Social Diary extends the current outreach of university resources and be beneficial to students in need of all kinds of support, especially mental support. 


**How we designed it:**

Using html, css, and javascript, we made a website where people can add posts of how they are feeling or anything they are currently struggling with. Other students, faculty, and UBC counselors can see these posts and are able to anonymously respond to studentsâ€™ posts to give support and advice.
