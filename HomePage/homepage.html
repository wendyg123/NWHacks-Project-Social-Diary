            <p class="description">We're currently living in a time where people have never felt more isolated and alone. Thus, we created Social Diary, a community where people can anonymously share their struggles and support each other so that none of us feel alone. Social Diary provides a safe platform for anyone who needs to express their emotions, tell a story, or maybe share an experience that brightened up your day.</p>
